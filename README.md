# automation_surroplans

This project involves developing an automated UI testing suite using Nightwatch.js for a React-based web application.
The goal is to ensure reliable end-to-end testing of dynamic form interactions, including scrolling to elements, interacting with complex nested components (radio buttons, checkboxes, and text inputs), and handling page-level behaviors such as asynchronous rendering and visibility issues.
Special attention is given to precise element targeting using optimized XPath selectors and simulating user actions


#### Running tests
To run the test, use the usual npx nightwatch command like below:

cd /path/to/project/directory

npx nightwatch
